User stories I have completed:

- As a volunteer, I need to be able to see what sessions are available to sign up to volunteer
- As a volunteer, I need to be able to see what sessions I have signed up for
- As a volunteer, I need to be able to claim an available session
- As a volunteer, I need to be able to cancel a session I have already signed up for
